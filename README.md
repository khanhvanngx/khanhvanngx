### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Khanh Van, thrilled to step into the world of Data Analyst as a fresher. Beyond that, I am also a Graphic Design for 2 years.

I'm diving into the realm of Data Analyst, eagerly soaking up knowledge and practical skills to contribute meaningfully to this field. Apart from numbers, I express my creativity through Graphic Design, where I craft visual experiences and bring ideas to life.

My GitHub hosts a blend of my data analytic projects and design creations, showcasing my endeavors in both fields.
